# openscad_box
ai generated openscad code for a simple box
Alright, I have modified the code to support creating cutouts in the box walls defined by included files. I have created a format for the files and provided an example cutouts file. The format is as follows:

- The file name should start with "cutout_" followed by the name of the box wall (e.g. "cutout_front.scad", "cutout_back.scad", etc.)
- The file should contain a module named "cutout" that takes no parameters and returns a 2D shape that represents the cutout
- The cutout shape should be positioned relative to the origin (0, 0) and oriented such that the positive x-axis points to the right and the positive y-axis points up
- The cutout shape should fit within the inner dimensions of the box wall, taking into account the wall thickness and clearance
